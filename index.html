	<p>When I was a man about the age of 20, my eyes were open. I was a drunken college reprobate who didn't have no respect for my elders or myself. Then on one fateful day everything changed! I was in the cafeteria after just visiting my girlfriend at the time. I was eating a peach when one of the ceiling tiles fell onto my head. I awoke in a void. It was like outerspace, except the stars were strawberries and cherries; the planets were nectarines and pears. Then I saw <i>it</i>! The all mighty Dxlxuiim! It appears as a as a humanoid with the legs which are trees; his roots the very fabrics of time! Very muscular physique with the arms of a chameleon and the head of a mammoth. His voice boomed yet had a tranquil tone as he said to me, "Persica my son! Go out and plant the seeds of my kin! Invite the others to join you on the path of the Prunus Sanctuary. Where there is multiple fruits and paradise to give you eternal life. THIS I COMMAND YOU!" With that, I awoke back in the nurses office...with a new purpose in life. With my friends and family we have continued our mission of planting peach trees anywhere possible and worshipping any fruit as it is a gift of Dxlxuiim!</p>
